        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of building software for e-commerce, health tech, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          My main focus these days is improving my abilities in full stack development. In my free time, I enjoy working on side projects and exploring new technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of the tech world, staying active is also important to me; I enjoy weightlifting. I also take care of my puppy, Milo!
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me. I'm always open to connecting and exploring new opportunities. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat or collaborate on a project!
        </p>
